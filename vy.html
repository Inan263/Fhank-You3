    <h1>Caroline Graham Hansen</h1>






       
 

<p>Caroline Graham Hansen (Norwegian: [kɑrʊliːnə ɡrɑːm hɑnsn̩]; born 18 February 1995)[2] is a Norwegian professional footballer who plays as a winger for Spanish Liga F club FC Barcelona and the Norway women's national team.

Hansen started out her professional career playing in the Norwegian Toppserien with Stabæk. She then spent the second part of the 2013 Damallsvenskan season in Sweden, playing for Tyresö FF. Hansen represented Norway at youth international level, and made her debut for the senior team in 2011. In 2013, 18-year-old Hansen played a major role in the Norwegian team that won silver at UEFA Women's Euro 2013.

Hansen made the move to the Frauen Bundesliga in 2014 to play for VFL Wolfsburg, where she began to develop multiple serious, long-term injuries between the years of 2015 and 2018. Despite this, she reached two UEFA Women's Champions League Finals with the club in 2016 and 2018, and won 8 major trophies- 3 league titles and 5 DFB-Pokal titles.</p><p> In the midst of her club success with Wolfsburg, she struggled with her national team. In 2015, she missed that year's World Cup due to injury, and in 2017, she was part of the Norway squad that had their worst-ever finish in a Euro tournament with 0 goals and 0 points.

2019 was a breakout year for Hansen, when she signed for 2019 UEFA Women's Champions League finalists FC Barcelona, and was one of the most noteworthy players of the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup with Norway.</p><p> She was nominated for multiple year-end awards for the first time, including The Best and the FIFA FIFPro World XI. Her successes continued with FC Barcelona as she was integral to the 2019–20 side that won their first league title since 2015. Hansen then went on to win the UEFA Women's Champions League with the club for the first time in 2021, as well as the continental treble.

Hansen is widely regarded as one of the best wingers in the world for her performances for both club and country.</p>
