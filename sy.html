    <h1>Aitana Bonmati</h1>






       
 

<p>Aitana Bonmatí Conca (Catalan: [əjˈtanə βɔmməˈti] listenⓘ;[note 1] born 18 January 1998) is a spanish professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Liga F club Barcelona[1][4] and the Spain national team. She has also represented Catalonia. She is considered one of the best players in women's football, and one of the greatest of all time. She was awarded the Ballon d'Or and The Best FIFA Women's Player Award for the 2022–23 season.[5][6]

Bonmatí has been with Barcelona since 2012, developing through La Masia for six years. She was promoted to Barcelona's first team ahead of the 2016–17 season, and made off-the-bench appearances for the club until her break-out year in the 2018–19 season. In 2019, she started the first UEFA Women's Champions League final of Barcelona's history, and later in the year was voted Catalan Player of the Year for the first time.</p>

<p>Throughout the 2020–21 season, Bonmatí was essential to Barcelona's continental treble-winning campaign. She had one of the most noteworthy performances of her career in the 2021 UEFA Women's Champions League final, scoring Barcelona's third goal and being named MVP of the final. In the 2022–23 season, she improved her goalscoring prowess, scoring 19 times in all competitions and leading her team to another domestic double and Champions League in what is the most-decorated season of any individual footballer.</p>

<p>Bonmatí found success with Spain's under-17, under-19 and under-20 women's teams. She has won two UEFA Women's Youth Championships – in 2015 with the under-17 team and 2017 with the under-19s – and has been runner-up in two FIFA Youth Women's World Cups – in 2014 with the under-17s and 2018 with the under-20s. She moved into the senior squad in 2017, featuring for Spain at the 2019 Women's World Cup and 2022 Women's Euro. She then had a starring role in the 2023 World Cup, where Spain won the title and she won the Golden Ball as the tournament's best player, and in the 2024 UEFA Women's Nations League Finals, where Spain again won and she was voted Player of the Finals. In 2024, she won the Laureus World Sports Award for Sportswoman of the Year and became the first footballer to win the award.</p>
