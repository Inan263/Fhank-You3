    <h1>Jana Fernández</h1>






       
 

<p>Jana Fernández Velasco (listenⓘ; born 18 February 2002) is a Spanish professional footballer from Catalonia who plays as a centre back for Liga F club FC Barcelona.
Fernández was born in Martorell in the district of Baix Llobregat in the Province of Barcelona. She began her football training at FC Barcelona's La Masia academy in 2014 at 12 years old.

Fernández made her debut for Barcelona in November 2018 at 16 years and 9 months,[1] while she was still playing with the club's Juvenil-Cadet section. She was the club's second-youngest debutant after FC Barcelona Femení's professionalization in 2015.[2]

In the summer of 2020, Fernández signed her first full-team contract for three seasons.[2]</p><p>

On 10 March 2021, she made her first start in the UEFA Women's Champions League in a 5–0 win against Danish side Fortuna Hjørring.[3] Barcelona went on to win the Champions League that year for the first time in their history. Fernández made 16 league appearances in her first senior season, a competition that Barcelona also won. On 27 May 2021, Fernández made her first appearance in the Copa de la Reina in a 4–0 win against Madrid CFF.[4] Barcelona won the 2021 Copa de la Reina on 30 May and completed the continental treble.[2]</p><p>

Fernández scored her first goal for Barcelona in 2021 in a 9–1 win against Deportivo Alavés.[5][6] On 14 February 2022, the club announced that Fernández had torn the cruciate ligament of her right knee and would be out for the rest of the 2021–22 season. She finished her season with 18 total appearances and two goals.[7] Injuries and discomfort continued to keep her playing minutes reduced into the 2023–24 season, though she managed more consistency towards the end of the season and was trusted for defensive security in the league.[8]</p>
