    <h1>Cata Coll</h1>






       
 

<p>Catalina Tomàs "Cata" Coll Lluch (Balearic Catalan: [ˈkatə ˈkɔʎ ˈʎuk] ⓘ ;[a] born 23 April 2001) is a Spanish professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Liga F club FC Barcelona and the Spain national team. In the summer of 2018, at the age of 17, she was one of the captains during the historic triumph of the Spanish U17 team at the World Cup. In the same year, she was a starter for the U20 side at the World Cup in France.
Cata Coll started playing football at the age of 6 in the Sant Marçal team. She began playing as a central defender until she tried goalkeeping at the age of 11. She played in boys' teams until she was 14 years old, when she moved up to the women's team after signing for Athletic Marratxí, before moving to Collerense.[7] In her last season, she was one of the key players in achieving promotion to the newly launched Iberdrola Challenge League.</p><p> After being a pillar in her team and standing out remarkably, Coll raised the interest of Primera División clubs, finally opting for the offer of Fútbol Club Barcelona. In July 2019, it was announced that she had signed a contract until 2023 and that she would play the first season on loan to Sevilla FC in the Primera División.[9][10] Coll began the season sharing minutes with Sara Serrat and Noelia Ramos, but as the games went by, she became the goalkeeper most used by the coach. In her first season in the First Division, Coll played 16 league games.</p><p>

In July 2020, Barcelona confirmed Coll was returning after having played the previous year on loan. In October 2020, Coll played in goal after an injury to Sandra Paños that kept her away from the pitch for several weeks. Coll stated Paños was her idol as a child.[11] Coll was decisive in the league match against Atlético Madrid, where she saved a penalty with the score still 0-0.[12] She debuted in the Champions League in a qualifying match played against PSV that the team won by 4 goals to 1.[13][14] In December 2020, she was injured in the match played against Sevilla. The club's medical services reported that she suffered a meniscus injury in her right leg.[15][16]  At the end of March, she received a medical discharge.</p>
