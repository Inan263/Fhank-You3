    <h1>Lilian Thuramiya</h1>






       
 

<p>Ruddy Lilian Thuram-Ulien (French pronunciation: [liljɑ̃ tyʁam];[4] born 1 January 1972) is a French former professional footballer who played as a defender. A quick, powerful and versatile player, he was capable of playing both as a centre-back or as a right-back, and was competent both offensively and defensively.

He began playing football professionally in his homeland with Monaco and played in the top flight in France, Italy and Spain for over 15 seasons, with notable stints in Serie A with both Parma and Juventus before finishing his career with Barcelona.</p>
<p> With France, Thuram was a key player for the team that won the 1998 FIFA World Cup; his side also won UEFA Euro 2000, and he helped them to runners-up at the 2006 World Cup. Thuram was the most capped player in the history of the France national team with 142 appearances between 1994 and 2008 until Hugo Lloris surpassed the mark in 2022.

Thuram has been described as a "studious" figure off the pitch;[5] in 2010, he became a UNICEF ambassador, and has stood out for his initiatives to fight against racism.</p>
